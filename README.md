# What is Front-End Development?

**Front-end development** refers to what the end user (also commonly referred to as the "**client**") can see. In the most basic forms, front-end development consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

As a developer, you will find that it is very easy for your front-end (website, web application, etc.) to become very complex and have a lot of different moving parts. It makes solving problems much more difficult when you have to go through a maze of code to find the issue.

Eventually, developers decided that there must be a better way to manage all of that code, so they created libraries that could make life easier. **React** was one of those libraries.

> React was created by Facebook and released to the public in May of 2013 and has been consistently maintained since then.

## Why React?

React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for front-end web applications.

Here are some of the advantages of React:

#### Speed

Interactive websites need to update the DOM (Document Object Model) each time a change happens. This process is generally resourceful and slow.

Compared to other libraries that manipulate the DOM, React uses a **Virtual DOM**, allowing to update only the parts of the website that have changed. This increases the speed of updates dramatically, as modern web applications may contain thousands of elements.

#### Ease of Use

React allows developers to group related code together, thereby making building and maintaining large scale applications much less complex.

#### Support

React has an amazingly large community and is open source. It is maintained by Facebook and the community.
