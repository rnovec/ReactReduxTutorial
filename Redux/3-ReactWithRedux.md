# Redux with React

Now, that we know what Redux is, we can start building React apps that use Redux!

First, we need to install Redux:
    
    npm install redux

This will install the Redux library.
However, Redux itself is just a small library, that can be used with different technologies.
To use it with React, we need to install another library, called **react-redux**:
    
    npm install react-redux

> The **react-redux** library binds React with Redux, allowing React components to read data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update data.
