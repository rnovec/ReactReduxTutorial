# Course Project

Throughout this course, we'll help you practice and create your own **Contact Manager** app using React, so you'll retain what you've learned and be able to put it to use.

Our Contact Manager will allow to view the list of contacts and add new ones to the list.

Check out a sneak peek of our Contact Manager app in action on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-contact-manager-4).

> Don't be afraid of the project code. By the time you complete the course, everything will make complete sense and look highly doable. We guarantee it!
